# Overview
Implemented a Non-Holonomous Differential Drive Robot Using A* Algorithm

# Dependencies
1. math library
2. matplotlib library
3. sys library

# Instructions to run for phase 3
The inputs are co-ordinates of start point, goal point and orientation of start point.
The inputs for start point are (-4,4), end point are (-2,0) and orientation is given as 0.

# Instructions to run for phase 4
The inputs for video 1 are (-4,4), goal point are (0,-3) and orientation is 0.
The inputs for video 2 are (-4,4), goal point are (4,2) and orientation is 0.

# Output
The program will display the shortest path after it is found.
Here is google drive link for the output video of phase 3.
